## Next Month Budget
We need to create the next empty month budget when creating current active month budget. When we start to fill the next month budget then we dinamically create the next one, and so on. 

## Currency Format
When edit account amount it prints decimals and currency symbol on the first number we type. This is not a problem when typing the first time we add a new account.

## Close/Re-open/Delete Account
We need to implement the logic for closing, re-opening, and permanent deleting accounts.
